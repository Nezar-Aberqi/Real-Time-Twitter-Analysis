## Real-Time-Twitter-Analysis 🤗

This notebook represents my work on a Datacamp Project. My main goal was to extract some important and useful insights from trending tags over the world and 
in the U.S, I managed to exploit json files obtained with the help of twitter APIs in order to make some intersting exploratory data analysis.
 Happy Coding 👨🏻‍💻
